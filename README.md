### About WinAGI:  

WinAGI is a full featured game development system, that includes editors which provide full control over of all resources in an AGI game. It includes several integrated tools to assist in game design and development, allowing you to create new AGI games more efficiently and with less effort.

### Known Issues:  

 - When installing, don't use a sub-directory of Program Files. There are weird file access permission issues that will prevent the app from running.

### History: 

**alpha12.1** Working on OBJECT file editor. Basic editing functions working, still need to add find/replace functions.


**alpha12.0:** Reserved Defines editor is complete. 


**alpha11.3:** GlobalList and ReservedList objects now work similarly to other game objects- with load/save/add/clear methods; cleaned up loadgame/newgame functions and logic editors and compiler to use the new objects.


**alpha11.2:** Global Defines editor is complete. Removed the 'High' setting for logic compiler errors. A few other minor bug fixes.


**alpha11.1:** Converting WinAGIv2 game files now add includes when game is first opened. Fixed some bugs in the logic compiler, the ReplaceAll function and resID mod function.


**alpha11.0:** Snippets editor is complete. Beginning work on defines editor. Major change in handling of defines. What were previously treated as 'built-in' (for resource IDs), 'reserved' (variables, flags, constants reserved by AGI) and 'global' defines now use real include files that must be added to every file using #include directive. (In WinAGI VB no #include directives were needed, the defines were automatically added by the compiler.) With this change, all source files are self-sufficient and will compile in any AGI compiler (e.g. AGI Studio). WinAGI automatically updates the three include files, and will add/remove the #include directives to/from the source files automatically as well. Users can opt to disable the auto-include feature if they wish to maintain all defines manually.  


**alpha9.0:** Character Map dialog to allow insertion of extended characters is complete and integrated into logic editor. When upgrading version 2 wag files, logic source files are backed up before being converted.  
  
  
**alpha8.0:** First public release. All game-level functions (opening, importing, creating new from blank or template, managing setting and properties, rebuilding/compiling, etc) and basic resource management (adding/removing, renumbering, exporting, importing, previewing) are functional. The only working editor is the Logics editor.
