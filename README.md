# WinAGI-GDS
For years I have wanted to move WinAGI from VB6 to a modern language. I chose C Sharp, and have started the process.

So far, I completed rewriting of the AGI object model (what was in WinAGI.dll); games and all game resources can now be opened/viewed/edited/saved.

I created the main MDI form, and the preview function. You can open a game, and preview all the resources. There are probably still a lot of bugs though.

I haven't started on any of the editors or tools yet.
