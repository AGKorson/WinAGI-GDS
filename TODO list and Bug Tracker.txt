      and creates a zero length file during the load attempt. ; if one doesn't
      the user should be told that, and (if in game) given option to create a new one; 
      
      
      // Linq feature makes it easy to check for invalid characters
      // Any applies the test inside to each element of the source
      // so testList.Any(checkItem.Op) returns true if checkItem.Op is true
      // for any element in testList!
      // to get control chars, I use a pre-built string
      if ((CTRL_CHARS + " !\"#$%&'()*+,-/:;<=>?@[\\]^`{|}~").Any(DefName.Contains)) {
        // bad
        return 13;
      }

      to print text:
      use graphics.DrawString

      to get height/width of text:
     //set property window split location based on longest word
      Size szText = TextRenderer.MeasureText(" Use Res Names ", new Font("MS Sans Serif", 8));
      PropSplitLoc = szText.Width;
      PropRowHeight = szText.Height + 2;

      changing to game object NOT being static; - need to re-check almost everything; specifically
       - reserved defines; most are static, and in the Compiler class; game-specific ones need to be  re-coded



!!! use a linked list for managing the MRU files; much easier than what I'm doing now; when adding new item to
the list, first check if it already exists; if it does, delete it, otherwise, delete last item on list, then
add new item to the top of the list - voila!

!!! now that I know how to convert text from raw byte code to codepage 437 (see decode logic), I think I can 
use that strategy to replace the ExtChar custom functions I wrote! should be easy to create a function
wrapper around that text - now I wonder if there's a similar conversion available in VB... the API functions
(MultiByteToWideChar and WideCharToMultiByte) might work, but I haven't been able to figure them out yet
